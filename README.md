## Film Query Project

#### Week 7 Homework for Skill Distillery

#### Overview

* This is a Film Query Project that allows the user to query film database for
  information such as look up a film by its id, and look up a film by a search keyword.
  The output also displays other relevant information the user may want to know
  about the film or actors in the film(s) displayed.


#### Topics/Technologies Used

* Java
* SQL
* ArraysLists
* JDBC
* Multiple Classes, interfaces, constructors, methods, and fields.


#### Lessons Learned


* With this project we got back into coding with Java. After learning the basics
of SQL and JDBC, having to merge the concepts was a bit challenging at first.

* This project took a lot of testing and verifying outputs for various menu options and
array lists. Verifying the code written was requesting the correct info, displaying it
in the correct manor, and in the correct menu option.

* The basic set up of this project took most of the time. Utilizing the ER Diagram
that was provided to us, allowed me to visualize the route the info would need to take,
in order to get the desired info from each table.
